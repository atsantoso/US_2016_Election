# 2016 US Election

The first analysis and modeling project I did during my BrainStation Data Science course. The objective of the project is to predict the US 2016 election based on features from the US demographic data alongwith the 2008 and 2012 US election data. The demographic data and 2008, 2012 election data is used as the training set while the 2016 election data is used the test set.
